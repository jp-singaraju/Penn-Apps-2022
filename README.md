**Project**

My team and I submitted Share. for the PennApps2022 Competition.

**What is Share?**

Investors like to talk. Just look at communities like r/WallStreetBets on reddit, which was over 12.5 million subscribers. Or even just overhear some conversations at your next party. People like to talk (and sometimes brag) about how their investments are doing. But these conversations happen on the edges. They're hidden between dozens of (admittedly funny) memes and sarcastic posts. That is, until now. Share is a platform for you to share how your shares are doing (pun very much intended). Post about your positions and your rationale behind them or read what other people are doing. You can join groups with your friends, family, and others to see who can get the highest return for their money. Share is a place for you to learn about and enjoy the thrills of the stock market.
